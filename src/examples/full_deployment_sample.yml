  A full test and deploy sample configuration.
  Test your app on every commit. On tagged commits, place the workflow on-hold after testing, pending manual approval for deployment.
  Receive a Slack notification when the workflow is placed on hold, and a notification whether the deployment fails or deploys successfully.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    slack: circleci/slack@4.1
  jobs:
    # This "test" job will run on every commit (as per our workflow)
    # We are ok with no notifications sent for this job.
    test:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:stable
      steps:
        - run: echo "test my app"
    # This "deploy" job will only run on a tagged commit (as per our workflow)
    # We want to be alerted both if this job fails, and when it succeeds.
    deploy:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:stable
      steps:
        - run: echo "deploy my app"
        # In the event the deployment has failed, alert the engineering team
        - slack/notify:
            event: fail
            template: basic_fail_1
            mentions: "@EngineeringTeam"
        # When there is a successful deployment, send a notification with a different template.
        - slack/notify:
            event: pass
            template: success_tagged_deploy_1
  workflows:
    test-and-deploy:
      jobs:
        # We want the test job to run on all commits, so we will list it with no filters.
        - test
        # When we are on a tagged commit (example "v1.0.0"), we want to also place the workflow on-hold, pending manual approval for deployment.
        # We will also make use of the Slack orb's "on-hold" job to notify us to this on-hold workflow, making it easy to respond.
        # Add a context containing your Slack OAuth token and optionally, default slack channel
        - slack/on-hold:
            context: slack-secrets
            requires:
              - test
            filters:
              tags:
                only: /^v.*/
        # Jobs with the type of "approval" act as place holders to pause the workflow, the job name does not matter.
        # Wait for both the test job, and the notification to send before pausing.
        - pause_workflow:
            type: approval
            requires:
              - test

            filters:
              tags:
                only: /^v.*/
        # The deploy job will continue once the workflow has been manually approved.
        - deploy:
            requires:
              - pause_workflow
