  Use the "branch_pattern" parameter to limit notifications to specified branches.
  Useful when a job is executed on multiple branches but you only wish to be notified on a subset of branches.
  For example: If your "build" job runs on every branch, but you wish to only be notified when a failure occurs on the "main" branch, your config may look like this.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    slack: circleci/slack@4.1
  jobs:
    build:
      machine: true
      steps:
        - run: some build command
        - slack/notify:
            branch_pattern: main # A comma separated list of regex matchable branch names. Notifications will only be sent if sent from a job from these branches. By default ".+" will be used to match all branches.
            event: fail
            template: basic_fail_1
        - slack/notify:
            branch_pattern: production # A second alert to ping certain folks to failures on this branch.
            event: fail
            template: basic_fail_1
            mentions: "<@U8XXXXXXX>, @UserName"
  workflows:
    deploy_and_notify:
      jobs:
        - build:
            context: slack-secrets
        # This deploy job uses the native CircleCI workflow filters to specify that the entire job will not execute unless on the specified filtered branch.
        # This Workflow level filter is independent from the Slack orb, and controls if the entire job is executed, as opposed to just the command in the orb.
        - deploy:
            requires:
              - build
            filters:
              branches:
                only:
                  - production
