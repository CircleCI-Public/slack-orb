## Custom Message Template

  1. Open the Slack Block Kit Builder: https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/
  2. Design your desired notification message.
  3. Replace any placeholder values with $ENV environment variable strings.
  4. Set the resulting code as the value for your `custom` parameter.

  ```yaml
- slack/notify:
      event: always
      custom: |
        {
          "blocks": [
            {
              "type": "section",
              "fields": [
                {
                  "type": "plain_text",
                  "text": "*This is a text notification*",
                  "emoji": true
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
  ```

## Branch or Tag Filtering

Limit Slack notifications to particular branches with the "branch_pattern" or "tag_pattern" parameter.

```
A comma separated list of regex matchable branch or tag names. Notifications will only be sent if sent from a job from these branches/tags. By default ".+" will be used to match all branches/tags. Pattern must match the full string, no partial matches. Keep in mind that "branch_pattern" and "tag_pattern" are mutually exclusive.
```

See [usage examples](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack#usage-examples).
