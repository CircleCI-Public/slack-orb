# Slack Orb ![CircleCI status](https://circleci.com/gh/CircleCI-Public/slack-orb.svg "CircleCI status")

Easily integrate custom [Slack](https://slack.com/ "Slack") notifications into your [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/ "CircleCI") projects. Create custom alert messages for any job or receive status updates.

Learn more about [Orbs](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/config-preview-sdk/blob/master/docs/using-orbs.md "orb").

## Dependencies / Requirements

- ### Bash Shell

Due to the limitations of the `sh` shell, `Bash` is required. `Bash` is the default shell used on CircleCI and the Orb will be compatible with most images. Images such as `Alpine` that do not contain the `Bash` shell by default are incompatible and en error message will be logged. You may install the Bash shell through your package manager (example: `apk add bash`) in the Dockerfile for the image you are using.

- ### cURL

cURL is used to post the Webhook data and must be installed in the container to function properly.
