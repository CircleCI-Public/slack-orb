Easily integrate custom [Slack](https://slack.com/ "Slack") notifications into your [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/ "CircleCI") projects. Create custom alert messages for any job or receive status updates.

Learn more about [Orbs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/using-orbs/ "Using Orbs").

## Usage
Example config:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  slack: circleci/slack@x.y.z/*

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: <docker image>
    steps:
      - slack/<command>
```

`slack@1.0.0` from the `circleci` namespace is imported into the config.yml as `slack` and can then be referenced as such in any job or workflow.

## Jobs

### approval-notification
Send an approval notification message

Example:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  slack: circleci/slack@x.y.z/*

jobs:
  - slack/approval-notification:
      color: "#aa7fcd" # Optional: Enter your own message

## Dependencies / Requirements

### Bash Shell
Because these scripts use bash-specific features, `Bash` is required.
`Bash` is the default shell used on CircleCI and the Orb will be compatible with most images.
If using an `Alpine` base image, you will need to call `apk add bash` before calling this Orb,
or create a derivative base image that calls `RUN apk add bash`.
If `Bash` is not available, an error message will be logged and the task will fail.

### cURL
cURL is used to post the Webhook data and must be installed in the container to function properly.

## Help

### How to get your Slack Webhook
Full instructions can be found at Slack: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks

1. [Create Slack App](https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button#register_your_slack_app). This will also be the name of the "user" that posts alerts to Slack. You'll be asked for which Workspace this app belongs to.
2. In the settings for the app, enable `Incoming Webhooks`.
3. In the left hand panel of your Slack app settings, under `Features` click `Incoming Webhooks`.
4. Click `Add New Webhook to Workspace`. You will be asked to pick a channel for the webhook here.
5. Done! A webhook URL will be created.

### How To Get Your Group ID
1. Navigate to https://api.slack.com/methods/usergroups.list/test.
2. Select the correct application under "token".
3. Press "Test Method".
4. Find your group below and copy the value for "ID".

### What to do with Slack Webhook
You can implement the Webhook in one of two ways, either as an environment variable, or as a parameter.

1. In the settings page for your project on CircleCI, click `Environment Variables`. From that page you can click the `Add Variable` button. Finally, enter your webhook as the value, and `SLACK_WEBHOOK` as the name.
2. You can enter the Webhook for the individual status or alert by entering it at the `webhook` parameter, as shown above.
